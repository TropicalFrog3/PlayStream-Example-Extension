# PlayStream Example Extension

An example extension for PlayStream that demonstrates video extraction using headless browser automation.

## Features

- 🎬 Extracts video URLs from encrypted streaming sources
- 🤖 Uses Playwright for headless browser automation
- 📺 Supports TV shows with multiple episodes
- 🔍 Automatic video source detection via network interception

## How It Works

This extension uses Playwright (headless Chromium) to:
1. Load the embed page in a headless browser
2. Intercept network requests
3. Capture the encrypted video.m3u8 URL
4. Return it as a playable video source

## Installation

### Download APK
Download the latest APK from the releases:
- [example-extension-v1.0.0.apk](build/example-extension/outputs/apk/example-extension-v1.0.0.apk)

### Build from Source

```bash
cd example-extension
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK will be generated at:
```
example-extension/build/outputs/apk/release/example-extension-release-unsigned.apk
```

## Testing (Desktop/JVM Only)

To test the extension on desktop:

```bash
cd example-extension
./gradlew runMain
```

**Note:** Playwright requires JVM and will automatically download Chromium (~100MB) on first run.

## 🔄 Platform Support

This extension automatically detects the runtime platform:

### Desktop/JVM (Testing)
- Uses **Playwright** with headless Chromium
- Requires ~100MB Chromium download on first run
- Full JavaScript execution support

### Android (Production)
- Uses **Android WebView** for video extraction
- No additional dependencies required
- Native Android integration

**Important**: Call `provider.setAndroidContext(context)` before using on Android.
